# tkinter-secure-login
My take on a Python Secure Login System.  I plan to use my YubiKey as one way to authenticate the user, as well as having a "guest" mode, which will require proper authorization in order to separate what each different login will have access to in the app. 

## Looking for documentation?
I placed my documentation for this project in my GoogleSite portfolio, feel freee to check it out!

## Sample Login Tests
You can test using these logins within my app, and they're hard-coded (username, password): <br>
'Regnarts' : 'Vh2@Ay%mO' <br>
'Pumpkin' : 'EOI2w*E5q' <br>
'Diligent' : '$qGYzn9Ax' <br>
'Joe' : '#H0FClkZu' <br>
'Issac' : '79Rx@TJ!U' <br>

## Create an "Account"!
Don't worry, I didn't make it so that every account was hard-coded, I made a "Create an Account" feature.

## What's with the Statuses?
I based them off the mafia hierarchy just because (I just finished rewatching JJBA Golden Wind)
